                <p>
                    When I first wanted to learn how to code I was completely lost. I was a finance major in the
                    university at the time and did not have any experience in the field of programming. However, I was into tech for some time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then at some point, after reading about many successful tech companies and realizing the capabilities of software at a high-level, I became interested in
                    acquiring the knowledge that would enable me to build one of those useful and cool applications that
                    everybody would use and talk about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Little did I know that the field of programming is very broad
                    and the topics and concepts that you can learn about are endless.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, quite naturally, I didn't know where to begin from.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fortunately for me, I happen to have family and friends who are familiar with
                    this subject or working as developers and took the time to guide me into this new path that was
                    lying ahead of me. However, this may not be the case for you, and you are still looking for the best
                    place to start learning about programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's where I come into play and try to be helpful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In
                    this post, I will provide you with some very useful (hopefully) resources that got me started with
                    learning how to code, and I believe can be very helpful for people that find themselves in the
                    starting line of their programming journey. These resources could also service people that already have some coding experience and are looking for new places to continue learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I cannot guarantee that the suggestions I am about to make are the best ones out there, but if they're not, they are very close and hopefully they will prove useful in this new mission that you have in your life - learning how to code (yeah I know - dramatic).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Quick advice</i>: 
                </p>
                <p class="ml-3">
                    Before moving on, I would like to say that if you are a complete beginner,
                    and you are just starting out with programming, I would suggest you begin looking into both the very basics of programming and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">computer science</a>.
                </p>
                <p class="ml-3">
                    By doing so you may be asked to learn about concepts that are not
                    directly related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming">computer programming</a> but learning about them could definitely contribute to
                    later getting the best out of solely programming courses.
                </p>
                <p class="ml-3">
                    Moreover, this path may prove a little
                    harder than jumping right to learning programming languages such as Python, where a lot of
                    abstractions are used. However, this way you will have a greater understanding of how you interact
                    with a machine when you are running your programs, and be able to understand various aspects of a
                    program's lifecycle and ways to make it perform better - making your code more efficient because of
                    that.
                </p>
                <p class="ml-3">
                    So, again, my advice is: invest your time and effort now - enjoy faster progress later. This
                    is what I did and I am pretty happy with the results and able to understand lower level concepts
                    better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With all that said, here are the platforms that made my programming journey possible:
                </p>

                <h3>1. <a href="edx.org">edX</a></h3>
                <a href="edx.org"><img src="images/edx.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></a>
                <p>
                    This website is a student's paradise. There is an endless amount of courses that you can attend on
                    almost every subject, and, for you and me, every aspect of programming you can think of: front-end
                    development, back-end development, databases, scripting, cloud computing, AI (artificial
                    intelligence), ML (machine learning), and a lot more. These courses can be attended either for a fee
                    or for free.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of the courses I have come across offer both paid and free versions. The only
                    difference between these two versions usually is that the paid version makes you eligible for a
                    course-completion certificate, once you have gone through all the lectures and completed all the
                    required course projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Big corporations, like Microsoft, Amazon and Google, and top-level
                    universities, such as Harvard, Cambridge and MIT, have published programs on edx.org that you can
                    follow. Usually, the courses have a structure that you are encouraged to follow. In some cases, you
                    have to complete lectures and projects within certain deadlines, and in other cases, you can follow
                    the programs completely at your own pace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    edX is the platform on which I had the first steps of my programming journey, and for that
                    reason, it has a special place in my heart. If you don't already have an edX account I highly suggest you create one. You're not going to regret it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first course I took on this platform, and one of the most impactful courses I have completed so
                    far, was the <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/HarvardX/CS50x3/2015/course/">Introduction to
                        Computer Science</a> (CS50 for short), taught by the one and only Havard professor <a
                        href="https://twitter.com/davidjmalan">David Malan</a>. If you don't know him, he is a computer
                    science teaching guru and you are going to love him as soon as you have watched one of his lectures.
                     
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main goal of this course is to provide you with the fundamental knowledge that you need
                    to later explore the programming path you are most interested in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you take this course you will
                    learn about different data structures, algorithms, cryptography, web development, memory management
                    and more! Moreover, you are going to get an introduction to many widely used programming languages
                    and most prominently C, Python, JavaScript,and then HTML and CSS. These last two are not programming
                    languages really. If someone told you they are, trust me, they are not (👀
                    <a
                        href="https://ischool.syr.edu/why-html-is-not-a-programming-language/#:~:text=HTML%2C as a markup
                    language,statements such as If%2FElse.&text=This is because HTML is not a programming language">here</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this course you will have to complete a series of projects to make yourself familiar with all
                    the different concepts that you are taught in each lecture. This way you can get your hands "dirty"
                    and gain practical experience at solving complex problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a huge fan of this program and I loved going through it. I followed an old version of it, but
                    there is a newer version (which you can find <a
                        href="https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/home">here</a>) too. If you plan
                    on taking or even
                    just trying out this course, I would suggest following the newest version (obviously) and the path that is suggested.
                </p>

                <h3>2. <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp</a></h3>

                <p>
                    This platform is a must if you want to explore or advance your skills in web development.
                    Everything, from front-end to back-end, APIs, and web development frameworks are taught here. The
                    curriculum is structured in (currently) 11 programs, or certificates, each one covering a different
                    programming topic, and today has expanded to topics other than web development too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I joined freeCodeCamp the site was offering only a few non-web development courses, but today
                    you can learn about Python for data science, and also about information security and machine
                    learning as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each program consists of one or more smaller sections. These smaller sections meddle with specific
                    concepts of the program's topic. For example, if you start pursuing the "Responsive Web Design
                    Certification" you will learn about HTML, CSS, Accessibility, Responsiveness, and more. This way you
                    can learn about all the most important aspects of a topic, or choose the ones that are of most
                    interest to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It may happen that you are familiar with some of the topics discussed in a
                    certificate, so you get the option to skip through those sections. In my opinion, following all the
                    sections of a program in the order they are laid out, would guarantee that you get the most out of
                    each program. This would be true, especially if you are a complete beginner, or have only a little
                    experience on the topic of a program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first program I went through was the "Responsive Web Design" certificate,
                    during which I learned a ton about web development, mostly on the front-end, different concepts and
                    best practices. I went from being a complete novel on web development to beginner and then finally
                    having a great understanding of many front-end technologies and tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later, I followed the JavaScript
                    program, called "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures", during which I learned a great deal
                    about algorithms and data structures (what a surprise), something that proved very important for me
                    to later get my first programming job.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of the time, algorithms and data structures are what
                    you get asked about during tech job interviews, and this certificate/program was a great
                    introduction into those concepts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recently, after being employed as a developer for some time now, I came back to freeCodeCamp to
                    explore all the new topics that have been added since my the last time I visited the website. I was
                    excited to see many new programs added and I intend to go through some of the them real soon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a proper teaching program should do, at the end of each freeCodeCamp program there is a number of
                    usually challenging projects that help you solidify the knowledge that you've received throughout
                    the duration of the certificate and put this knowledge into practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students should complete these
                    projects, in order for a program to be considered completed, and for the student to be able to
                    receive a certification of completion of the program. These projects usually try to make use of all
                    the tools and concepts taught in the program, and you can find them at the very bottom of a
                    program's curriculum page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This has two benefits:
                </p>
                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        You get practical experience so that you are more comfortable developing similar, if not more
                        advanced projects, in the future. I would also like to add that you can use these
                        projects in your project portfolio - an essential "weapon" to have when looking for a job as a
                        developer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The certification of program completion acts as a confirmation of your competences and skills in
                        a specific field, and you can use it to assure potential employers of your ability to complete a
                        role's duties. 
                        <p>
                            There is, even, an option to add the certificate straight to your
                            "Certifications" sections of your LinkedIn profile. I only recently did this, but I realised I
                            should have done it a lot earlier, as it definitely increased the traffic on my profile.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes you will come across smaller challenges, in between different topic sections, that will
                    solidify concepts and information you have gone through so far. And, more often than not, following
                    along the lecturer and their actions, will let you get more out of each lecture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Considering all these things, it is clear that this is a huge amount of information and practice
                    that you can receive from this platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's awesome here is that everything is offered to you for free! You can access all of the
                    platform's material when you have created an account on it. How cool is that!
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point I have
                    to mention that, if you do take advantage of this awesome platform, please consider contributing to
                    its maintenance and development by donating a small amount to it.

                <p>
                    Lastly, another high-quality and course-packed platform is Coursera. Coursera has a huge library of
                    courses on various topics, and one of them is programming and computer science in general. Similar
                    to edX, Coursera offers programs from web development to machine learning and almost any topic of
                    programming you can think of.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can expect very good quality of content and preparation here, and the support offered to you is
                    exceptional too. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Programs in this platform can be either free or paid. I am not a very heavy
                Coursera user, but, so far, I haven't come across programs that offer both paid and free options.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, if you are lucky, Coursera offers scholarships, part or full, for their paid programs,
                that you could apply for and attend a whole program for less or no cost at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is how I
                    started using Coursera myself. After I had completed the CS50 course (on edX), I was full of enthusiasm about
                    my newfound ability to build things from scratch and having a machine perform them for me. As I
                    wanted to explore the different areas that programming extends to, I started looking online for
                    different opportunities to do so. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Very soon I came across an Android course that was taught by
                    Google in cooperation with Coursera's team. As there was a full scholarship being offered to a
                    number of candidates for this program, I immediately applied for it. A few weeks later I got a reply
                    saying that I was offered the scholarship and that I had access to the program's material.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To be
                    honest, I don't remember the name of the course, but after completing this course on Android developent, I attended another
                    course on Coursera, this time on web development - again with a full scholarship. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For some strange
                    reason I am not able to find the programs I completed on my "Purchases" or "Accomplishments"
                    sections of my profile (maybe I did something wrong at the time), and this is why I am not in a
                    position to point you to those programs. Nonetheless, they were crucial for me to understand how web
                    and mobile applications work, and get some practical experience in these fields while completing the
                    courses' mandatory projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it comes to my experience with Coursera, I am very satisfied with the structure of the programs
                    I followed (which I believe is very similar to other Coursera programs) and with the learnings I got
                    from it, the knowledge of programming concepts, and the amount, difficulty and quality of the
                    projects completed during these courses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have tried some other paid platforms (that I am not going
                    to talk about in this blog post) and I can confidently say that Coursera offers some of the best
                    paid programs online, and a great number of quality, free courses too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As my experience with Coursera is not as extensive as in the cases of edX and freeCodeCamp,
                    that's all I can say about it. This definitely doesn't mean that Coursera is inferior to the other
                    two platforms - I would say they are around the same level. It just happens that edX and
                    freeCodeCamp satisfy my learning needs and structural preferences better.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-top: 4em;">
                    A strong side benefit of going through courses on such platforms, which often offer an element of
                    self-paced learning, is that you become familiar with the process of doing research on your own, to
                    find hints and information on coding concepts that you need in order to successfully implement
                    solutions to projects assigned to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Or, let's be real, copy solutions from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> and paste them into your code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Plus, as mentioned ealrier, by completing projects you will start building, or expanding, your portfolio, that you can later show to potential employers to prove your knowledge and experience in coding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, some of my suggestions will appeal to you and motivate you to start exploring the
                    programming world. It is an exciting thing to do, that of learning something new and promising -
                    more so in the case of programming as it will ultimately give you the ability to create things from
                    the ground up and probably affect the lives of other people in a positive way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'd love to learn about your journey and what you create through or because of programs taught in the platforms mentioned in this post. You can connect with me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisPetalotis">@ChrisPetalotis</a> and let me know.
